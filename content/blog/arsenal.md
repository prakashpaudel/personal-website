This week, Ars√®ne Wenger managed his last game for Arsenal Football Club. He's been manager of the team for 22 years. I haven't known another manager since I began watching football. I want to write a bit about what it's been like to follow Arsenal and Monsieur Wenger all these years.

As a young kid growing up in Asia, becoming an Arsenal fan was by chance. I didn't have any connection to the club. I just watched whatever match was on TV. It just happened that in 2003, Arsenal was on the way to having the most remarkable season, the Invincible season. They went a whole season (38 games) undefeated. The only precedent to this was when Preston North End went undefeated in the inaugural football league in 1889. Yes, that's right, what Arsenal did hadn't happened since the 19th century.

Safe to say this made me a religious support. I worshipped the likes of Thierry Henry and Dennis Berkamp.

As for Arsene Wenger, he was more like a dad. You'd hear him giving inspiration before the game in his eccentric words and phrases. Pushing the players on during it with an occasional water bottle kick here and there. After the game, no matter the result, he stood by the players and the team.

If a player made a mistake, he'd never criticize them. He'd rather feign poor vision and claim he didn't see what happened. A rather stubborn old man.

Perhaps the most influential Wenger moments for me came in recent years.

Arsenal went into decline after that incredible Invincible season. A number of factors meant that we lost our best players and didn't have money to buy replacements. We went without winning any trophies for 10 years.

Towards the tail end of those years, Wenger faced an incredible amount of pressure to quit. Fans flew planes over the stadium saying #WengerOut. The media asked him about his future every single week. This went on for years.

Every August began with hope and expectation, but by spring there was always frustration and disappointment. Arsenal were just not good enough to win against opponents with more money, better tactics or sometimes just more luck.

I was watching a man who I idolized as a god become a mortal. His face showed it. He had more wrinkles and his hair was going greyer. After the worst defeats, his eyes were blood-shot. You could feel the suffering.

Despite this, Wenger showed complete self-belief. He stood by his players, his tactical choices and was stubborn as ever. He'd never admit defeat.

I'd sometimes miss Arsenal games, but I'd make sure to go back and watch Wenger's post-match interview. Especially if it was a loss.

The man's self-belief was inspirational beyond football. Anytime I'd face a setback, I'd recall Wenger and re-watch his last interview.

He did catch the occasional break. A run of good form, an upset against a better rival, a trophy. These moments were extra special for me. His face was lit up again, he was cracking jokes and his infamous smirk was back.

With Wenger departing, I have a strong feeling of sadness. For me, Arsenal is Arsene Wenger. I've never known an Arsenal without Arsene.

In football, the manager determines the tactics of the team. With Wenger, he determined the identity of the whole club. It's the beautiful style of football he brought to the team. The stadium he built. The players whom he molded from promising youth to world beaters.

Countless former players have thanked him for not only making them great players, but great men. I want to thank Mr. Wenger too as he helped shape me as well.

Of course, Arsenal will be around, and so will I. But neither of Us will be the same without Arsene. It's time for a new chapter for the club and maybe a new chapter for me. One where my idol isn't there talking to me week in week out. I hope I can make him proud.
