I picked up David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs after reading the author's original short piece on the subject, [On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs: A Work Rant](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/).

It was like a gospel for my soul. I've been in a couple jobs that I would consider bullshit, most notable on wall street. Even jobs I thought weren't bullshit had large elements of bullshit sprinkled in. And thanks to Nassim Taleb's book, Antifragile, my allergy for bullshit has become quite strong.

That's why I picked up this book, hoping it would bring some insight into these jobs and why they even existed.

David starts off working towards a definition of what constitutes a bullshit job. His narrative is guided by the thousands of responses he received from readers of his original piece. The first few chapters give a clear insight into bullshit jobs and the large extent to which they have proliferated through modern workplaces.

The anecdotes he shares from readers alone are very interesting and will sound familiar to most of us. But don't let the title fool you, this isn't a run-of-the-mill work rant.

In the later half, he combs through the history and evolution of work to figure out why some work has become meaningless. A Sapiens-esque approach, that is quite convincing. By the end, I was left loathing the state of affairs, but without the author offering a clear solution. This felt right, as the problem of bullshit jobs doesn't have an obvious remedy.

Sadly, the book does get a little dry at times. But don't let the dull parts stop you, there is a lot of great insight into society and human psychology to pick up, especially in the last two chapters.

Overall, Bullshit Jobs gave me much more than I expected. I imagined a cheeky, enjoyable rant about work, and why it sucks. Instead I got a revelation and a medium dose of existential dread. I'll save the details for those who wish to read.

Finally, should you read it? Only if you can handle a potential existential crisis. More seriously, I would read the [original essay](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/) as a litmus test to see if you'll enjoy the full text.
