Last week, google showed off a really cool demo phone call. Google's AI called a hair salon to setup an appointment. It went something like this:

```md
AI: Hello, I'd like to make a hair appointment for my client for, umm, the Wednesday the 7th for 12pm.

Salon (Actual person): Ok. Give me oneee second.

AI: mmhhmm

Salon: We don't have anything for 12, we do have a 1:15.

AI: Umm, I'm looking for something between 10-12 actually.

Salon: Depends what she is looking for. What service does she want?

AI: Just a women's haircut for now

Salon: Ok, I think I can get her in at 10am. Thanks.

AI: Ok, thanks! bye.
```

The transcript of the conversation doesn't really stand out. It's not too far off from the Google Assistant.

The biggest surprise was how natural the AI sounded.

Ordinarily, it's pretty easy to tell when you're speaking to a robot versus a human. But, this robot was convincing. Both for the Salon and me as an outside listener.

Having listened a few more times, I think there's two things that set it apart from previous iterations.

First, the AI speaks with imperfection and variation. It doesn't pronounce words identically each time.

Second, it adds filler words, like _umm_ and _ahh_. It even uses _mmhhmm_ instead of a more defined affirmative response like _yes_, _yep_, or _sure_.

These may seem like trivial things to us. But it seems to make a big difference in our interpretation of what is natural speech and what is not.

Regarding, the _intelligence_ of the robot, I don't think there's a great leap here. Making an appointment is a very well-defined task. There's only so many possibilities for where the conversation can go.

This takes me to the bigger picture. Clearly, robots will start sounding more and more human-like.

In 5 years, most of our appointments may be made by robots. Heck, (x.ai)[x.ai] has already been doing it through email for a few years.
Will we be able to tell who's making an appointment? Probably not.

But, I still don't see anything here that signals progress towards general intelligence. Sure, we will have robots good at making routine phone calls. Will it be able to call my mom and check-in with her? Probably not anytime soon.
