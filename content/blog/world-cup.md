This world cup has been something special. I can't recall another league or cup that had more unpredictability.

Favorites out again

Argentina last minute save to last minute loss

Japan's underdog story

A new finalist

Really anything can happen (nobody knows)

Why is soccer so unpredictable (share some reading links, maybe summarize in a para)

Share my highlights from all the games so far.

Unlike me, most people didn't watch every game. So, I wanted to share my favorite moments. Including those that may have slipped under some peoples radar.

> Belgium vs. Japan (goals, upset, misery, the cruelty of football)
> France vs. Argentina (best game so far, messi out, the goals wow)
> portugal vs. spain
> russia's surprise for everyone
> Germany out in first round (a pattern that keeps going)

Let's talk about the 2006 world cup. It was held in Germany, and as beaten finalist in 2002, they nearly went all the way. Losing to eventual winners Italy in the semi finals.

Not many upsets here. All the big guns made it to the late stages.

The most memorable moement is without a doubt the Final.

Zidane, arguably the best midfielder of his generation, was playing his final tournament. Italy meanwhile had a team of vetrans 90s superstars. The last tournament with the old-fashion 90s feel, before tiki-taka took over in 2010.

What most people will remember is Zidane's headbutt on Marco Materazi. A moment of madness from the best player of his generation. Ultimaetly, this cost france the title. With italy winning in Penalities.

So that makes this my 5th tournament. For me, this World Cup has been the best of the bunch, by miles.

Don't get me wrong, the other ones were great too. Who can forget the 7-1 thrashing Germany inflicted on Brazil in 2014. Zidane's headbutt in the 2006 final -- the last game of his career. Or Ronaldo's haircut from 2002.

Every world cup has it's incredibe moments. It never goes down straigh forward. So what has set this tournament apart from the others?

Going into the tournament, people were somewhat spectical.

I think it comes down to the quality of the games and the resulting drama. The big boys left early. Germany, Argentina, Spain, Portugal all knocked out before the quaterfinals.

For italy:
this was the last of the warrior teams. Playing in a 'old-fashion football' from the 90s. None of this tiki-taka stuff common these days.

The World Cup is nearing an end, and I'm really going to miss it.

For me, this has been the best World Cup I've witnessed. It had it all. Bangers,
