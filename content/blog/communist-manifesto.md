It's right. It's great to hear marx talk about ideas that i've been having back over 100 years ago. before aircrafts, internet or anything.

Society feels like it's the same as he described then. We have a elite ruling class with capital and wealth and a large general class that is dependent on labor for basic capital for sustainance.

One class gets money freely. One class has to work for every penny and if they stop working, they're done for.

The problem is clearly that communism hasn't worked practically. Marx even suggests so much. He agrees that this makes sense theoretically, but what about practically. Gotta read on.

Would I support a political movement that was truly communist? I'm not sure.
