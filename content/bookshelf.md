I was inspired by patrick collison who shared a [virtual bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf) reflecting his real bookshelf.

I don't maintain a real life bookshelf since I move around often. But, here's some books that I've read recently. I've bolded the ones I find especially great. These are in no specific order.
