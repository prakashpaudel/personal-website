I was inspired by patrick collison who shared a [virtual bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf) reflecting his real bookshelf.

I don't maintain a real life bookshelf since I move around often. But, here's some books that I've read recently. I've bolded the ones I find especially great. These are in no specific order.

* 1984, Orwell
* **Sapiens, Hariri**
* Kafka By the Sea, Murakami
* **Norwegian Wood, Murakami**
* Vagabonding, Potts
* Steppenwolf, Hesse
* Siddhartha, Hesse
* The Autobiography of Gucci Mane
* Brave New World, Huxley
* **Selfish Gene, Dawkins**
* The Travelers, Pavone
* Asimov Short stories, Asimov
* **Anti-fragile, Taleb**
* Demian, Hesse
* Heart of Darkness, Conrad
* The Communist Manifesto, Marx
* The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Murakami
