Hey! I'm Prakash, a full-stack software developer based in Africa. I build mobile and web apps, primarily in javascript.

Most of my time is spent with React (and React Native) and I have been creating production sites with it since 2016. For backend, I stick with Rails, but sometimes experiment with Node, particularly Next.js.

I love to read and you can check out some of my favorite [books](/bookshelf). Or read my old [blog](/blog) (which has admittedly died a slow death).

I'd like to start using this site to share some of my personal projects, but we're not there yet!

I am occasionally available to new consulting oppurtunities. Feel free to reach me at [pp@prakashpaudel.com](mailto:pp@prakashpaudel.com)
